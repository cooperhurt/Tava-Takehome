# Tava-Takehome

This is a simple takehome project to TavaHealth.

## Starting the project

To initialize the project you need to run one of two things:

```nodejs
npm i
```

and

``` 
cd server && npm i 
```

Or alternatively there is the following command which will do both for you.

```
npm run initialize
```

Afterwards this should spin up and the up should be interactive.

**Client Side**: localhost:3000

**Server Side**: localhost:8080

## Gotcha's

Running this in CodeSandbox it appears some PUT, PATCH, and POST requests are not working, you may need to run locally to get the full functionality of the application.
